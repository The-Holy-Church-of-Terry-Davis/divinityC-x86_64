# Divinity
The Holy Church Of Terry Davis would love to present
our new flagship project: Divinity! This is an x86_64
operating system written in C, C#, and x86_64 assembly!

This is a passion project and is likely to be unstable
for most cases! But this is our hurrah for Terry himself.

## Prerequisites
To run the development version of this project you
will need to have Qemu and dotnet 7.0 installed.

```
sudo apt install qemu-utils qemu-system-x86_64 dotnet-sdk-7.0
```

## What is this about?
This is our servers official monument to Terry Davis with a
minimalistic TempleOS functionality based OS! Including our
own integrated <a href="https://github.com/YendisFish/Emerald">scripting language</a>
(which also happens to act as a general purpose C based language),
tinkering tools, and whatever else we decide to throw in there!
